# TOH-Sim
## Tower Of Hanoi Problem : 
- Tower is a classic problem where you have to move all the stack of disks from one peg to another peg using one auxillary pegs(rods or towers).
- Initially, all of the disks are stacked on top of each other with larger disks under the smaller disks i.e., the smallest disk is placed on the top.
- The objective of the problem is to move the entire stack to another rod (here considered C), obeying the following simple rules:
  - Only one disk can be moved at a time.
  - Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
  - No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
## The Simulator
- The problem can be easily visualized and understood using this simulator.
- It simulates each and every step of the solution of this problem visualising the disks going from one rod to another.
- It also keeps the log of each and every step it performs.
